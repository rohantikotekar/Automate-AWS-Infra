# NexusCloud - Next generation cloud automation

> **Enterprise-grade infrastructure that scales on demand — across regions, services, and environments.**

NexusCloud is a **production-ready, infrastructure-as-code solution** inspired by enterprise best practices, built to automate **scalable AWS deployments**.  
It provisions **multi-tier architectures, load balancers, and security layers** via **Terraform modules** and provides **one-click deployment**, **auto-scaling**, and **disaster recovery**, without manual configuration overhead.
